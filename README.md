# hello-world
Creating first repository, really just a test.
In this repository, I could store my old work from BEN 580 which was a MATLAB based course.

BEN 580: learning about basic and complex computational techniques that can be applied to the biomedical engineering field, 
exploring the fields of radionomics and computational engineering with biomedical data, and becoming farmiliar with software MATLAB, R, ImageJ/FIJI.

The course consisted of 10 total assignments of varying difficulty. 
In this repository there will be the scripts written that were submitted and the PDF file submitted outlining what was done in the script, answering specific questions
outlined in the assignment, and any relevant figures that were created.
